Python Data Visualization Project

This repository contains a hands-on project to learn data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Project Breakdown

The project is divided into nine tasks, progressing from fundamental to more advanced plotting techniques:

      Basic Plots: Learn to create fundamental plots like line plots, scatterplots, and pie charts.
      
      Statistical Plots: Understand data distributions with histograms and how to combine multiple plots on one axis.
      
      Advanced Matplotlib: Explore subplots to arrange multiple visualizations and even create 3D plots.
      
      Seaborn Integration: Use the Seaborn library to create enhanced scatterplots and count plots.
      
      Seaborn Advanced Plots: Master more complex visualizations with pair plots, distribution plots, and heatmaps.
